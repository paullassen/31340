# 31340 - Digital Control

This repository contains the code used to control a sorting machine. The machine sorted blocks of various lengths into 3 categories: long, medium and short.

The blocks were placed on a conveyor belt which fed into an actuated ramp, which would rotate to deposit the blocks into one of three bins. The goal of this project was to run the conveyor belt as fast as possible while still sorting the blocks accurately
